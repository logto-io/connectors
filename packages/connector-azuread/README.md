## Set up Azure AD in the Azure Portal

- Visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and sign in with your Azure account. You need to have an active subscription to access Azure AD.
- Click the **Azure Active Directory** from the services they offer, and click the **App Registrations** from the left menu.
- Click **New Registration** at the top and enter a description, select your **access type** and add your **Redirect URI**, which redirect the user to the application after logging in. In our case, this will be `${your_logto_origin}/callback/${connector_id}`. e.g. `https://logto.dev/callback/${connector_id}`. You need to select Web as Platform. The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page.
- If you select **Sign in users of a specific organization only** for access type then you need to enter **TenantID**.
- If you select **Sign in users with work and school accounts or personal Microsoft accounts** for acccess type then you need to enter **common**
- If you select **Sign in users with work and school accounts** for acccess type then you need to enter **organizations**
- If you select **Sign in users with personal Microsoft accounts (MSA) only** for acccess type then you need to enter **consumers**

## Configure your client secret
- In your newly created project, click the **Certificates & Secrets** to get a client secret, and click the **New client secret** from the top.
- Enter a description and an expiration.
- This will only show your client secret once. Save the **value** to a secure location.
