# Contribute to Logto official connectors

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Logto's official connectors.

[Connector](https://docs.logto.io/docs/references/connectors/) is Logto's solution to access third-party services such as SMS, email, or social identity vendors.

As we mentioned in [Logto monorepo guidelines](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), you may join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/cyWnux4cH6) and check whether other community members are developing your desired connector.

Here is a [link](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/create-your-connector/) for some insights into developing a connector. From this document, you can also find the way to install your connector locally and check whether it works fine.

You need to test your connector on your local machine, and it would be good if you could attach screenshots to show your testing results in different cases. After finishing the implementation, you may also write a README file to show how to compose the connector's configuration.

All new connectors added to this repo will be published as Logto official connectors, which could be used by lots of users.
